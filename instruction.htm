	<h1>How To Play PokeWordle</h1>
	<p>To begin, you may select a difficulty level.  The difficulty level will determine the amount of guesses you will be given. Your goal is to guess the secret Pokemon's name in the amount of guesses given! After 2 guesses, you will be provided with the Pokemon's primary type as a hint. After 4 guesses, you are given the Pokemon's secondary type.</p>
	<p>After each letter guessed, the color of the letter tiles will change to
		show how close your guess was to the actual secret pokemon name.</p>
	<h2>Example:</h2>
	<p>A gray tile means the letter is not in the Pokemon's name.</p>
	<p>A yellow tile means the letter is in the Pokemon's name, but is
		in the incorrect position.</p>
	<p>The "c", "p", and "u" are in the secret Pokemon's name but not in the correct
		position.</p>
	<p>A green tile means the letter is in the secret word and
		is in the correct position.</p>
	<p>The "a" is in the word and in the correct position</p>
